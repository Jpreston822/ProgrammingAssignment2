## Caching the inverse of a matrix

## This function will create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) i <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get, setsolve = setsolve, getsolve = getsolve) 
}


## This function will compute the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by the previous funcation above.  If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix has not changed then this function should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(i)
        i
}
